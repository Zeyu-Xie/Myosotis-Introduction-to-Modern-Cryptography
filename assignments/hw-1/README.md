# HW-1 RSA Encryption/Decryption Cryptosystem Implementation

## Description

In this project, I independently implemented an RSA encryption/decryption cryptosystem using C++, which has been verified for reliability by 334 groups of RSA-128 random tests.

However, there are still two unresolved disadvantages with this project:

1. I employed the Miller-Rabin Test to generate random large prime numbers. However, I have only identified 8 pseudoprimes up to the first eight prime numbers. I have not found research on larger pseudoprimes, nor can I compute them using my MacBook. This implies that although the likelihood is small, it is still possible to generate composite numbers.
2. I packaged the entire project within a Docker container and ran it on both my MacBook and Lenovo PC. Surprisingly, it runs approximately 5 times faster on the Mac than on the PC. Nonetheless, it still takes 10 seconds to process one group of data. Despite attempting various optimization methods, the speed remains unsatisfactory. üêå

Despite these two disadvantages, I completed the testing and recorded the data in `log.txt`, while other files comprise the codes and executable files. `Bint.hpp` serves as the header file for a class designed to process very large integers, whereas `func.hpp` contains simple functions necessary for the process.

For validation purposes, you can execute `docker build -t gcc_11 .` to construct the Docker image based on the current file. To run the container, please utilize `docker run -i -v .:/app -t gcc_11`. If you are utilizing a Unix-based system, it is preferable to directly execute `./main.sh`, which is a simple script file for smoother execution of the Dockerfile.

P.S. Alternatively, you may choose to run the makefile independently without using Docker. However, please be aware that the random seed I have employed might not function as anticipated, particularly on Windows platforms.

## Algorithm

### RSA Encryption/Decryption

Given a short string s (no more than 128 bits), we aim to encrypt and decrypt it with RSA-128.

Firstly, we convert s into a large integer M, ensuring that $M<2^{128}<10^{39}$.

Next, we find two random prime numbers p and q such that $p,q\geq10^{40}>10^{39}>M$.

Let $n=pq$, hence $\phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)$.

Let $e=2^{16}+1=65537$, it is established that e is a prime number. We require $\gcd(e,p-1)=\gcd(e,q-1)=\gcd(e,\phi(n))=1$. If this condition is not met, we regenerate p and q until success.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we can find d such that $d\equiv e^{-1}\bmod{\phi(n)}$.

With these parameters, we define the RSA public key as (n, e) and the private key as (n, d).

During encryption, we calculate $M'\equiv M^e\bmod{n}$, and $M'$ becomes the encrypted data. During decryption, we compute $M''\equiv(M')^d\equiv M^{ed}\bmod{n}$. Accoring to Euler's Theorem, $M^{\phi{n}}\equiv 1\bmod{n}$, thus $M^{ed}\equiv M^{k\phi(n)+1}\equiv M\bmod{n}$‚Äã.

Hence, $M''=M$ represents the plaintext and decrypted data.

### Miller-Rabin Test

We seek to determine whether an positive integer n is prime. For small n, we can attempt division with all prime number $p\leq n$. However, this approach costs $O(\sqrt{n})$ time, which becomes impractical for large n.

Miller-Rabin devised a clever method to address this issue.

Given a prime number p and another positive integer a such that $\gcd(a,p)=1$, by Fermat Little Theorem, we have $a^{p-1}\equiv 1\bmod p$. Suppose $p-1=2^sd$, then we consider the following s numbers: $a^d, a^{2d}, a^{2^2d},...,a^{2^{s-1}d}\bmod p$.

If none of these are congruent to $-1\bmod p$, then we obtain $a^d\equiv1\bmod p$. Otherwise,  $-1\in \{a^d, a^{2d}, a^{2^2d}, ..., a^{2^{s-1}d}\}\bmod p$.

Conversely, if there exists a number a comprime to n $(n\geq2)$, such that
$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
\left\{
\begin{aligned} 
    a^d &\not\equiv 1 \pmod{n} \\
    -1 &\not\in \{a^d, a^{2d}, a^{2^2d}, \dots, a^{2^{s-1}d}\} \pmod{n}
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
$$
then n is not a prime number.

For a composite number n and a positive integer a such that $\gcd(a,n)=1$, if a satisfies $\eqref{eq:1}$ it is termed a "witness" of n. For a prime number n such that none of the first m prime numbers (i.e. $P_m=\{p_1=2, p2=3,...,p_m\}$) is a witness of n, then n is called a "pseudoprime" of m.

When $m=8$, $P_8=\{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19\}$. It has been proved (*Jiang and Deng, 2014*) that in the range of $[1, Q_{11}]$, there are only 8 pseudoprimes. Thus, it suffices to test $P_8$ and exclude those 8 pseudoprimes.

However, for a larger range than $[1, Q_{11}]$, information on pseudoprimes remains unknown. Therefore, there are still risks in directly using $P_8$.

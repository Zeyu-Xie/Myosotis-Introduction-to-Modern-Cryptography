Task: 

1. Achieve the RSA algorithm
2. Find a faster way to calculate the modular exponentiation: 

Hints:

- prime numbers p and q
- CRT(Chinese Remainder Theorem)

Questions

1. What is the differenct in speed between $c^d\equiv m \mod{n}$ and $c^d\equiv n$
2. Use CRT to compute $c^d\equiv m'\mod{p}$ and $c^d\equiv m''\mod{q}$â€‹ 
3.
